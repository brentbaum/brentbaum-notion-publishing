> "Many problems are best solved by working in two phases, one in which you let yourself make mistakes, followed by a second in which you aggressively fix them."

__Paul Graham__

> "Sales is all about momentum. This means you usually don't want to hit a home run the first meeting in sales.

By the time you work up to hitting a home run the deal will be yours"

__Erik Udstuen__
