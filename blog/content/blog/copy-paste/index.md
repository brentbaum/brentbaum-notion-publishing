---### When is it the right decision to copy and paste a block of code?

+ Only two, slightly differing use cases for that block (when the third occurs, consider refactoring all three)

+ The originating block is working and cost of failure is high

+ Bringing a piece of an external library into your codebase

+ Refactoring would create an unnecessary, heavy abstraction

+ Prototyping or writing throwaway code.
